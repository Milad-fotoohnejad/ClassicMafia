## Tech-Stack explanation

For this project I am planning to use a full-stack (FireBase, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS) which is a popular choice for building websites. Here is the information for your tech-stack and tools:

## Programming Language(s): JavaScript
Tools and Frameworks being used:
FireBase (version 11.5.0) as the NoSQL database to store the game data, player data, and other data related to the website.
ExpressJS (version 4.18.1) as the web framework to handle the server-side logic and routing for the website.
ReactJS (version 18.2.0) as the JavaScript library for building the user interface of the website.
NodeJS (version 18.13.0 LTS) as the JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side.
## Libraries and APIs I might use:
Here are some Libraries and APIs that I may use during building the website. Since I never used any of them before, I might change this document moving forward building the website. Here are the Libraries and APIs:
### FireBase-Admin Node.js (version 11.5.0): 
Firebase-admin is an official library provided by Firebase, it allows you to interact with the Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Cloud Storage and Firebase Cloud Messaging using Node.js.
### PassportJS (version 0.6.0):
Passport is Express-compatible authentication and authorization middleware for Node.js. The API is simple: you provide Passport a request to authenticate, and Passport provides hooks for controlling what occurs when authentication succeeds or fails.
### Socket.io (version 4.5.4): 
It's a bidirectional event-based communication library to handle the interactions between the players in the game.
### ExpressJS (version 4.18.1)
Express.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building web applications. It runs on Node.js and is designed to simplify the process of creating server-side applications. With Express, you can define routes and handle HTTP requests such as GET, POST, and PUT easily.
- Routing: Express makes it simple to define and handle different URL routes within your application.
- Middleware: Express provides a way to execute code for each incoming request through the use of middleware functions.
- Template engine support: Express supports several template engines, including Pug, EJS, and Handlebars, making it easy to render HTML pages with dynamic data.
- Database integration: Express can be integrated with databases such as MongoDB and MySQL for storing and retrieving data.
## Data stores or databases: Firebase
Development tools: Visual Studio Code (version 1.74) with the following extensions:
Prettier (version 9.10.4) for code formatting
ESLint (version 8.32.0) for ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions
Reactjs code snippets (version 2.4.0) for React snippets
## Development tools (if VSCode include any extensions you are using)
For my website project, I will be using Visual Studio Code as my primary development tool. To help me improve my productivity and code quality, I will also be using the following extensions:

- Prettier - a code formatter that automatically formats your code according to a set of rules.
- ESLint - a linting tool that helps you find and fix coding errors and potential problems in your code.
- GitLab Workflow - a Git tool that provides the information and shortcuts to access Git information from within Visual Studio Code.
- The Node.js Exec - is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows developers to easily run Node.js scripts directly from the editor. This extension makes it easier to debug and test Node.js code without leaving the VSCode environment.
- React Code Snippet - is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides code snippets for React. It helps developers to write code faster and reduces the time needed to remember syntax.
By using these extensions, I can improve our development speed, reduce the number of coding errors, and make my code easier to read and maintain.
## Testing tools
I am using Jest as a testing tool. Jest is a JavaScript testing tool that's often used with React. It provides a simple and efficient way to write and run tests for your React components, and its API is designed to be user-friendly and easy to understand. Jest has a large community of users and developers, and it's well-supported by the React team, making it a great choice for anyone looking to test their React projects.
## Integration tools
I wil use GitHub for my integrations in this project. GitHub is a platform that can be used as an integration tool for software development projects. It provides features such as version control, collaboration, bug tracking, and project management. It can be used in conjunction with other tools such as continuous integration and deployment tools like Jenkins streamline and automate the development process.
## What you will need for hosting
CloudWays is a popular cloud-based hosting platform that provides easy hosting solutions for a variety of websites, including those built with React. It offers a user-friendly interface, reliable infrastructure, and optimized performance for web applications. With features like 24/7 support, automatic backups, and managed security, CloudWays is a great option for hosting a React-based website.
